Installation instructions
*************************

===================
System requirements
===================

* A 64-bit Mac (Snow Leopard or later: Mac OSX 10.6) or Linux (2.6
  kernel or later) operating system with at least 4 GB of RAM is
  recommended.  Sequedex is straightforward to run under Windows and
  we provide installation instructions below using the Linux
  distribution, but a release packaged specifically for the Windows
  operating system is not available at this time.

* Sequedex requires version 1.7 of the 64-bit Java SE runtime
  installed.  Because of some platform- and Java version-depencencies
  with memory management that can adversely affect performance, we
  have distributed Sequedex with an open source build of Java 1.7.  It
  is possible also to use Sequedex with other 64-bit versions of Java,
  such as those found at http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp or
  that may already be installed on your computer.

* With the included data module, bact403, Sequedex uses a maximum Java
  heap size of less than 4 GB.  The larger 'tree of life' data module,
  tol-all, requires 29 GB of RAM, and is designed to run on a system
  with 32 GB of RAM.  Although such desktop computers can be acquired
  for under $1000, or even as a laptop, we have also made smaller
  versions of this data module available (tol-half and tol-quarter),
  designed to run on computers with 16 and 8 GB of RAM, respectively.
  It is best if the computer has sufficient memory available as RAM,
  but swap to solid state disk may give acceptable performance on some
  platforms.  For example, we found that Sequedex ran at ~1/2 speed on
  a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X Snow Leopard with 2 GB of memory and
  SSD.  Swap to conventional hard disk should be avoided if possible.

* If you are installing Sequedex remotely on a server, you will need
  to have at least a minimal X-windows environment installed, since
  Sequedex requires a GUI for the licensing step.  Note that ssh -Y
  enables forwarding of X-windows on most systems.

=================================
Downloading and unpacking for Mac
=================================

Download a package for your operating system at
http://sequedex.lanl.gov, then follow the instructions below.

Double-click on the .dmg image you just downloaded. This will open a
window showing the Sequedex icon and several other files.  Drag the
testData.tgz archive to a convenient place on your system, such as the
desktop.  Double-click on the testData.tgz archive icon to create an
uncompressed testData folder.  You will need this data for the testing
step later.

Drag the Sequedex icon to the applications folder. Open your
Applications folder, and click on the Sequedex icon. When the dialog
asking "Do you want to run this application?" appears, click on
"Open". If you did not previously have Java installed, the system will
prompt you to install Java at this time.  Once the Sequedex window has
appeared click on the "Run Sequescan" button.  If you have not had
Sequedex installed, a window will pop up asking you to accept license
terms.  Once you have hit "Okay", you are ready to test the
installation as outlined in the instructions below.

Advanced Mac users who wish to access Sequedex through the
command-line interface should add the app bin/ directory to their path
by issuing the following command for the bash shell::

   echo 'PATH="/Applications/Sequedex.app/Contents/Resources/bin:${PATH}'>>~/.profile

The corresponding command for csh or tcsh users is::

    setenv PATH ${PATH}:/Applications/Sequedex.app/Contents/Resources/bin

===================================
Downloading and unpacking for Linux
===================================

Linux binaries are distributed as a tar.gz archive at http://sequedex.lanl.gov.  

Obtain and untar this file into the Sequedex subdirectory (tar -zxf
Sequedex-1.0.0.tar.gz) from a directory where you want the
installation (usually /opt for a system-wide install or your home
directory for a personal install).

Add the sequedex/bin directory to your path (in a bash shell with
installation in your home directory, this is done with
PATH=~username/sequedex/bin:$PATH); consult your distribution's
documentation if you don't know how to do this.

Once you have added the bin directory to your path, you can run
sequescan by typing sequescan with no arguments at a shell prompt.
This will bring up a Sequedex window, from which you can enter various
options and run sequescan.  As with the Mac instructions above, the
first time you click on the "Run Sequescan" button, you will be
prompted to accept the license terms.  Once this is done you are ready
to test the installation as outlined below.

.. _s.install.cyg:

Downloading and unpacking for Windows 7 with Cygwin installed
=============================================================

Sequedex has not been packaged as a Windows application yet, but you
may be able to get it working as we did.  While we recommend using
Sequedex in conjunction with Cygwin, this is primarily for convenience
in analyzing output files and running downstream analyses.  Begin by
obtaining the Linux tar.gz archive at http://sequedex.lanl.gov.

If not present on your system, install Version 7.x of the 64 bit Java
Runtime Environment (or Java Development Kit) from
http://java.sun.com. Sequedex will not work properly with the 32 bit
versions.  If a version of Java is distributed with Sequedex, make
sure it is for Windows.

If you would like to run Sequedex under the Cygwin environment, simply
add the the Java jre7/bin/ and sequedex/bin/ directories to your
cygwin PATH variable and invoke the GUI with 'sequescan' or the
command line version with 'sequescan run' command.  Note that the
license request file can only be created from the GUI.

================================================================
Downloading and unpacking for Windows 7 without Cygwin installed
================================================================

Unzip the Sequedex distribution in the location of your choice
(eg. c:\\cygwin\\home\\username\\, or c:\\Program Files). The
top-level Sequedex directory name will be Sequedex.  Add the directory
with Java to your PATH variable, and define SEQUEDEX_HOME,
SEQUEDEX_DATA, and SEQUEDEX_ETC as user variables.  In the case of
SEQUEDEX_HOME, the '\' needs to be doubled, to '\\'.  For example,
SEQUEDEX_HOME should be set to C:\\cygwin\\home\\username\\sequedex.
Specifically, in Windows 7, you should:

1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Right-click on ‘My Computer’
3. Left-click on ‘Advanced System Settings’
4. Under the ‘Advanced’ tab of the ‘System Properties dialog box, click on ‘Environment Varibles’
5. Click on ‘New...’ under the ‘User variables’ list at the top of this box
6. Enter the variable name, ‘SEQUEDEX_HOME’ and the variable value corresponding to the location of Sequedex in your filesystem, (eg. c:\\cygwin\\home\\username\\sequedex, or c:\\Program Files\\sequedex).  Do the same for SEQUEDEX_DATA and SEQUEDEX_ETC.
7. Scroll dowin the ‘System variables’ variable list until ‘Path’ or ‘PATH’ is visible, click on it to highlight, then click on the ‘Edit’ button under the list. If no path variable is defined, click on the ‘New...’ button and define one.
8. Press the ‘End’ button on your keyboard to add text to the end of the ‘Variable value’ box
9. Add the Java executable to your path variable by typing ;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\ in this dialog box if Java is installed in its default location. Substitute the appropriate location if it is installed elswhere. Sequedex will only work with Version 6 of Java.

To run Sequedex, open an MS dos command prompt from the start menu, and type::

   java -Xms512m -Xmx6000M -jar %SEQUEDEX_HOME%\lib\sequescan.jar

and the Sequedex GUI will open.  Select input files and other options
as desired and click on 'Run Sequescan'.  The user can place the java
line into a file, sequescan.bat, right-click on this file in Windows
Explorer and 'send to desktop' to enable initiation of Sequedex by
double-clicking on an icon.

=========================
Testing your installation
=========================

To test that Sequedex is installed properly, open the Sequedex GUI,
click on the file chooser icon at the right edge of the "Input" text
field.  Mac users should find the testData directory described in the
installation instructions above.  Linux users will find the same
testData directory at the top level of the Sequedex distribution
directory (i.e. in the same place as the bin directory).  Under the
testData directory, users will find another directory called
"synthetic" and should then select one of the files under this
directory.  Click "Run Sequescan" button...

Note: If you have not yet installed a license file, the following
message will appear in the Progress window of the GUI::

 You are currently unlicensed.   Limited analysis will be allowed for testing purposes.

Instructions for installing a license are provided below.

========================================
Running Sequedex on an example data file
========================================

To analyze a file of sequence data with Sequedex:

*  Click on file chooser icon at the right edge of the "Input" line (Mac) or type 'sequescan' at the command prompt after correctly updating your PATH variable (Mac or Linux).  You should get an interface like the one shown below.
*  Select the testData directory you installed earlier
*  Select one of the files under one of the sub-directories of "testData"
*  Click "Run Sequescan"

   The graphical user interface for sequescan.

After the "Run Sequescan" button is pressed, a few lines should appear
in the "Progress" portion of the interface immediately. Sequedex will
spend about one minute reading the bact403, and about 15 minutes
reading the tol-all signature list into memory.  Once this is
complete, processing of the data files will occur at a rate of a few
billion base pairs per second.  We will examine the run-time options
and output files in the next chapter.

====================================
Obtaining a node-locked license file
====================================

Without a license file, Sequedex will only analyze a few tens of
thousands of reads at a time, and batch file processing is disabled.
This will enable the user to analyze bacterial genomes and portions of
metagenomics data sets to verify that Sequedex is performing
correctly.  You may obtain a free 60-day node-locked demo license by
submtting a license information file by e-mail.  The terms of the demo
license are available :download:`here <dl/license.txt>`.

To request a license, you must first create a license information
file: start the Sequedex GUI and click on 'Utilities' at the top of
the GUI, then on 'Request license'.  Follow the instructions to
generate a license information file.  E-mail this license information
file to to sequedex-demo-license@lanl.gov. A demo license will be
returned to you immediately if your e-mail address has not requested a
demo before.  This file can be installed by choosing 'Install License'
under the same 'Utilities' tab at the top of the sequescan GUI.  If
the license is correctly installed in the .sequedex subdirectory of
your home directory, you will notice that mutiple threads and
multi-file processing is enabled.  If 'verbose' mode is selected, you
will be notified that 'License level is 1' will be displayed as
Sequescan starts its run.  Since the license file is stored outside
the Sequedex root directory, this file will not be overwritten when
Sequedex is upgraded with a new distribution.

==================================================================
Installing new data modules and upgrading Sequedex - User-installs
==================================================================

New data modules can be installed into a Sequedex distribution by
copying them into the sequedex/data/ directory.

A new Sequedex distribution can be installed directly with the install
script if available (and if the existing version of Sequedex was set
up in the default location) or by unpacking on top of the existing
Sequedex distribution.  Since the license file is located outside of
the Sequedex distribution (in the .sequedex directory of the user's
home directory) for User-install, it will be unaffected by a
re-install of Sequedex.

====================================================================
Installing new data modules and upgrading Sequedex - System-installs
====================================================================

The license for Sequedex is node-locked, and not restricted to a
single user.  Consequently, the license file can either be located
within the Sequedex distribution **(where?)** or copied into each
user's home directory, into the .sequedex directory.  Note for Cygwin
users, that the home directory is the Windows home directory
(Typically c:\Users\home\username\) and not the Cygwin home directory.
For system installs, all users must have read **(and execute??)**
permissions to the Sequedex distribution, and new data modules can
only be installed by someone with write permissions to the
sequedex/data/ directory.  **What about edits to sequescan and
sequescan.conf?**
