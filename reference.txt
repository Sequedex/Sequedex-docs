Command line options for sequescan
==================================

The arguments for sequescan can be listed by typing::

 ~/sequedex/bin/sequescan run -h

at the comand line, resulting in the following output::

 Command line execution of sequescan run mode:
 sequescan run [-h] [-q] [-c config_file] -d data_module [-o output_directory] [-s function_set] 
           [-a min_prot_frag_length] [-t thread_num] [-f database_writer_flag] [-l] INFILE

 Example:
 sequescan run -d Life2550-4GB.0 -s seed_0911.m1 -f 1 /Users/jsmith/mgData

 Option descriptions:
 -h    mode help
 -q    quiet option - less messages to console or progress window
 -c    user-defined configuration file (overrides system configuation file)
 -d    name of data module
 -o    user-defined directory for data output (default is directory where input is located)
 -s    name of function set
 -a    minimum protein fragment length (overrides configuration file; default is 15)
 -t    maximum number of threads in threadpool (default = 1)
 -f    database writer flag (arguments:  0 = no, 1 = yes); analysis_writer_list in config determines type of database 
       (currently fasta/fastq file)
 -l    required if INFILE contains list of fasta/fastq files; if argument is "none", the list contains absolute paths;
       otherwise argument is base directory and paths in list are relative to base directory;
       when paths are relative to base directory and the -o option is set, output will inlcude relative paths

 INFILE may be a fasta/fastq file, a directory with fasta/fastq files, or a file containing a list of fasta/fastq files.  
 However, only fasta or fastq files or their gzipped (.gz) versions with an extension in the config file parameter 
 fa_ext_list will be processed.

 Parameters:
   INFILE is the input file in FASTA format.  Complete paths, relatives paths, and symlinks
   may be used here.

To check a specific environmental variable, add the variable as an argument to sequedex-config::

 sequedex-config SEQUESCAN_HEAPSIZE

and to change a particular variable, provide both the variable name and a new value::

 sequedex-config SEQUESCAN_HEAPSIZE 3000

Configuration options
=====================

The configuration options for sequescan can be seen by typing::

 cat sequedex/etc/sequescan/sequescan.conf

producing::

 ; Windows style configuration file (INI file) where
 ; Properties:  name=value
 ; Sections:    [section]
 ; created by M. Bussod

 ; should always be current version


 ; Parameters in this configuration file always evaluate to string values unless the parameter
 ; name ends in one of the following suffiexes: 
 ;    *_int:     evaluates to an integer type.
 ;    *_bool:     evaluates to a boolean type.
 ;    *_float:     evaluates to floating type.    
 ;    *_intList:     evaluates to a comma-separated list of integer types.
 ;    *_boolList:     evaluates to a comma-separated list of boolean types.
 ;    *_floatList:     evaluates to comma-separated list of floating types.    

 ; extensions of possible output files (files generated during a run depend upon options selected):  
 ;    .tsv - tab-separated files as documented in the Sequescan design document.
 ;    .fa   - nucleic acid fasta file of matching reading frames 
 ;    .fq   - nucleic acid fastq file of matching reading frames
 ;    .log - logging file.
 ;    .json - JSON file
 ;    .json and .tsv files for the most part have the same content in different formats


 ; runtime values used by this config file
 ;    DBNAME         ; signature data module name for this analysis from the -d option 
 ;    SCHEME        ;  function scheme for this analysis from the -s option

 ; environmental variables used by this config file (if not set, launcher script will set default values)
 ;    SEQUEDEX_HOME      ; path to the Sequedex distribution directory
 ;    SEQUINATOR_COMMAND ; full path to the command which launches the sequinator program (currently a javascript application)
 ;    SEQUEDEX_USERDIR   ; default is currently ~/.sqdx on Linux and Mac
 ;    SEQUESCAN_ETC ; path to the Sequescan etc directory (which is where, for example, the default sequescan.conf file is located


 ; Strings enclosed in matching pairs of percent signs will be passed for environmental variable expansion.
 ; Where paths are relative in config file, on Linux these will be relative to working directory 
 ; when using Mac app, they will be relative to /? (since working directory for app is /)
