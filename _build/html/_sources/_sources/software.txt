Chapter 7: Additional software tools and resources of use in conjunction with Sequedex.

Sequedex was designed to rapidly and robustly classify short fragments of genomic data according to the phylogenetic and functional annotations of signature peptides.  The raw input to sequedex consists of one or more fasta files of sequence data.  The raw output of sequedex is a set of tab-delimited text files, providing phylogenetic and functional profiles, as well as a matrix of the number reads assigned by both phylogeny and function (the 'Who does what?' matrix).  In this chapter, we introduce the user to a variety of software packages and how we have found them to be useful in the process of organizing data files and understanding the output.  This is neither intended to be an exhaustive list of software packages nor a tutorial in using any of them; it is simply a short sketch of how we used widely available software to better understand the output of Sequedex.

1) the command line with standard tools (Linux, Mac, Cygwin for Windows)

converting fastq to fasta

extracting columns from output files and assembling them into data arrays

2) phylogenetic and functional rollups with gfortran 90 code

3) annotating phylogenetic and functional profiles with gnuplot

4) exploring phyloxml trees with Archaeoptrix (Linux, Mac, Windows) www.phylosoft.org

5) creating synthetic data with MetaSim

6) statistical analysis and graphing with R

7) statistical analysis and graphing with Python

8) graphing and sorting with Excel

9) the SEED website

10) the Kegg website

11) Ecocyc

12) Bergey's manual
